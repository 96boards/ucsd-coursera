<h2>About LightWAVE</h2>

<p> <b>LightWAVE</b> is a lightweight waveform and annotation viewer and editor.
Use it to view any of the recordings of physiologic signals and time series
in <a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">PhysioBank</a>, together
with their annotations (event markers).

<p> LightWAVE runs within <a href="browser-compatibility.html">any modern web
browser</a> and does not require installation on the user's computer, tablet, or
phone.  LightWAVE is free software licensed under
the <a href="COPYING.html">GPL</a>.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<ol>
<li> On the <b>Choose input</b> tab, select one of PhysioBank's databases.
(Learn more about them in PhysioBank's
<a href="http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/">index</a>.)

<li> Once you have chosen a database, a <b>Record</b> selector appears.  Choose
a record.

<li> Once you have chosen a record, LightWAVE's <b>View/edit</b> panel opens,
showing the first 10 seconds of the record.
</ol>

<h3>Controls:</h3>

<p> To find out how any LightWAVE control works, move the pointer over it,
and a tooltip with a brief description will appear after a short
interval.  Click (tap) a tab (Choose input, View/edit, etc.) to open it.

<dl>
<dt><b>Choose input</b></dt>
<dd>Return here to select a different record.</dd>

<dt><b>View/edit</b></dt>
<dd>This panel contains navigation controls and indicators along its top edge.
Click the <button>&#9654;</button> button to start or pause <em>autoplay</em>.
Below, the <em>signal window</em> shows an excerpt of the record named in the
upper right corner.  The time indicators along the lower edge of the signal
window indicate the elapsed time from the beginning of the record, in hours,
minutes, and seconds.  The signal window is 10 seconds wide initially; use the
slider below it at right to change its width.

<p>
Use the navigation controls to view any other location in the record.  For
example, enter a time in the box next to <b>Go to:</b>, then press [Enter] or
click (tap) the <button><b>&#x21b4;</b></button> (refresh signal window) button.

<p> Use the <button>Find...</button> button to specify a search target (a type
of annotation to be found), then use the <button>&lt;&nbsp;Search</button>
and <button>Search&nbsp;&gt;</button> buttons to find the previous or next
occurrence of the target.  Clicking on <button>Find...</button> opens a dialog
box.  Enter an annotation mnemonic, such as N, V, or A (hover over <b>Search
for:</b> to see a tooltip that describes more options), and choose an
annotation set to search if more than one set is available.

<p> While autoplay is paused, click on any of the labels on the left side of the
signal window to cycle among three display states (hidden, highlighted, and
normal).  At most one signal and one annotation set may be highlighted at a
time.  Change the scale of a highlighted signal using
the <button>&#9650;</button> (expand), <button>=</button> (restore to default),
and <button>&#9660;</button> (shrink) buttons.  Click on the red circle to hide
or restore the grid, or the blue circle to hide or restore the annotation
markers.
